# Opencart Fast Product Price Editing
This small extension list all products with pager, you can see your products on list with price and edit product's price. Just change product's price and click save, change other and click save. 

# why ?
I wrote this after adding all products and want to change products price with my customer. You can use when necessary it.

# Installing
  - Login as admin 
  - From menu -> Extentions -> Install Extention,  after opened page browse zip file and upload.
  
  
  * Some versions you must set permission, From menu -> Settings -> Users -> User Groups select your user group and click edit link. Select all permission item and save changes. (After save there is no change you should re-login as admin)
  * First usage page opening is too slowly because OC re-generade product images, you can edit product page limit on product.php file or product image size on some page.
